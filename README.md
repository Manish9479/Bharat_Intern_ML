# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! Here you'll find Jupyter notebook code for three different projects:

## 1. House Price Prediction

Predicting house prices is essential in the real estate market. In this project, I've implemented a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house prices. The Jupyter notebook code for this project is available [here](link_to_code).

## 2. Wine Quality Prediction

Understanding the quality of wine is crucial for wine enthusiasts and connoisseurs. In this project, I've developed a machine learning model using linear regression to predict the quality of wine. You can access the Jupyter notebook code [here](link_to_code).

## 3. Iris Flowers Classification

Classifying different species of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals is a common task in botany. In this project, I've created a machine learning model for iris flower classification using Jupyter notebook and the associated code can be found [here](link_to_code).

Feel free to explore these projects and learn more about machine learning and data analysis! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.


**Happy Coding!**
